# Knowledge Distillation applied to Computer Vision

## Overview
This project investigated the feasibility of applying knowledge distillation to a computer vision task and was sponsored by the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/) as part of their [Junior Research Associate Scheme](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/undergraduate-research/junior-research-associates).
I demonstrated model compression successfully, decreasing the file size of a computer vision model (whilst maintaining a relatively high accuracy).
Conducted over three months, I believe my research made a relevant contribution to the field, further demonstrating the viability of knowledge distillation for improving the accessibility of computer vision models.
